	abstract     = {Although it is commonly expected that a metal disk placed on the surface of water will sink, our investigation has revealed a surprising phenomenon: a vertical jet directed onto the disk from above can allow it to remain afloat. This result defies intuition, as one would assume that the force of the jet's impact would cause the disk to sink.We have discovered that this phenomenon occurs as a result of water displacement from the top of the disk caused by the impacting jet, operating through a mechanism similar to a classical hydraulic jump. This displacement generates a difference in hydrostatic pressures, resulting in an upward buoyancy force capable of balancing the force of gravity. In contrast to the classical case, here the jump radius is fixed by the geometric parameters of a disk, a phenomenon we refer to as the parametric hydraulic jump. To further explore this effect, we have presented a theoretical model based on scaling laws, which provides the conditions required for the disk to float. The dimensionless scaling constant's value was determined through an independent experiment. Finally, we conducted experiments on the disk's floating and sinking, which showed a good match with the proposed theory.}

However, fluctuations are no guarantee that a loop will form, as shown by loop-free networks driven by oscillating flows. We provide a complete stability analysis of the dynamical behaviour of any loop formed by fluctuating flows. We find a threshold for loop stability that involves an interplay of geometric constraints and hydrodynamic forcing mapped to constant and fluctuating components. Loops require fluctuation in the relative size of the flux between nodes, not just a temporal variation in the flux at a given node. Hence, there is both a minimum and a maximum amount of fluctuation relative to the constant-flux component where loops are supported.}

Our analysis reveals anticipatory behavior in both women and men who expect to become parents. We observe a decrease of approximately 20 percent in mothers' income post-birth. In contrast, the income of fathers surpasses that of non-fathers both pre- and post-birth, suggesting that the fatherhood child premium may be primarily driven by selection. We note an increase (decrease) in hours worked for fathers (mothers). Finally, we compare the gender gaps in income and wages between women and men in the sample with those in a counterfactual scenario where the entire population is childless. Our findings indicate no statistically significant gender gaps in the counterfactual scenario, leading us to conclude that parenthood drives the gender gaps in income and wages in Poland.}
