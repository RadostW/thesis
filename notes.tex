\begin{enumerate}
    \item what characterizes macromolecules
    \item separation of timescales, brownian motion (following 'physics of complex colloids' pg. 512 by Nagele)
    - navier stokes equation\\
    - speed of sound - incompressibility tsound = l/c\\
    - re is low (replace weird velocity estimate in Nagele, Boltzman velocity + size from the DNA works)\\
    - laminar (linear) NS equation\\
    - vorticity diffusion equation\\
    - momentum relaxation time - Raighley particle\\
    - Brownian particle - Brownian timescale\\
    - summary - Stokes equation\\ ('physics of complex colloids pg. 514 by Nagele)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why go from Langevin to Ito, brief introduction to Ito integral (Ottinger 'Stochastic processes in Polymeric Fluids ' pg.87)
    - Langevin equation of Brownian motion of a sphere\\
    - Moments as heuristic integrals\\
    - Problems with heuristic integrals (nowhere differentiable paths, unbounded variation)\\
    - Wiener integrals of step processes, step process aproximations\\
    - W dW integral\\
    - Ito's lemma - transformations of SDEs, d(W2) = 2 W dW + dt - exotic integrals exists in nature, sum of squares\\
    \item Bead modelling - interaction tensors ('6.2 Mobility and friction matrices' pg. 559-564 Nagele)
    \item Rigid macromolecules - computing Rh (GRPY, Zeno)
    \item Conformational sampling
    \item Brownian Dynamics
    \item From ensemble to hydrodynamic size
